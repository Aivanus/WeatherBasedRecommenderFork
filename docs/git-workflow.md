# Git Workflow and branching

## When you start to do something new

Create a new branch for every new feature. Publish the branch and open a pull request early on - this helps to avoid merge conflicts.

`$ git pull` 

`$ git checkout -b <your-name/branch-name>` (i.e. jonijoensuu/frontend-skeleton)

`$ git add -A $ git commit -m "<your-comment>"` 

`$ git pull`   (to make sure you do not miss changes other have done)

`$ git push origin <name-of-your-branch>`

Add text "Closes" and the issue number at the beginning of your pull request comment. 

`Closes #<issue-number>`

When a pull request is merged, the issue is then automatically closed. Create a task in the sprint backlog, if you are missing a suitable issue.


## When you review a pullrequest by another team member

Always test the changes locally in our own environment before giving a review. 

`$ git fetch origin` 

`$Â git checkout <branch-name>` 

`$ git pull origin <branch-name>`

Make sure you understand what the code does.

If you do some minor fixes, you can make a commit to the same branch.

If there is a need to make more changes, add your review comments and choose then *Request changes*.
